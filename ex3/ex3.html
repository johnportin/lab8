        Biography
      </h3>

      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Tobie.
        I was born into a litter of five.
        My mom thought I was weak because
        I was small. I guess they called me the "runt."

      </p>
      <p>

        One day, a some strange humans came to take me away from my mom.
        They were nice to me. They fed, bathed and pet me.
        I spent thirteen years living with them.

      </p>
      <p>

        Behind our house was a park. The family - mostly my new mom and dad - would take me on walks there daily.
        Occassionally I got to go to a facility where there were many other dogs.
        My parents dropped me there in the morning, and picked me up at night.
        I had time to play with the other dogs, and made many friends.

      </p>

      <p>
        My two favorite activities were chasing squirrels and chasing humans. 
        I loved standing in the back door protecting the yard.
        When I spot a squirrel, I immediately let out a terrifying pig squeal, and chase that vermin out of the yard.
        Inside, my family has a round table. 
        We love to run in circles, occasionally changing direction suddenly!
        I'm not sure exactly what the game is, but I know that I always win.

        Near the end of my life, I developed liver cancer.
        I started to slow down. Jumping on the couch became hard, and long walks were tiresome.
        My family continued to care for me during this time.
        They made sure I was comfortable.
        Since I wasn't digesting food very well, they added chicken and eggs to my food for some
        extra flavor and calories.

      </p>
      <p>

        On April 15th, 2021 I made my peace with the world.
        I went with my family to the vet, and I never left.
